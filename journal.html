	<h1 style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size: 18px;">10/5/23: My other journal enteries dissapeared because I didn't save them.  Oops.  Also, I changed some background images on Journal and Projects and changed fonts on these pages.  Also I made my person card.  That's all for today!</h1>

	10/12/23: Today I made a console file and messed around with some javascript.  Thats all for today!

	
	10/19/23: Today I was learning how to make jumpscares.  I also added text to the homepage.  That's all!
	
	
	10/24/23: Started working on Spotispy jumpscare.  Don't wanna waste to much time writing in the journal so I'll end it here for today.
