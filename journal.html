	<h1 style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size: 18px;">10/5/23: My other journal enteries dissapeared because I didn't save them.  Oops.  Also, I changed some background images on Journal and Projects and changed fonts on these pages.  Also I made my person card.  That's all for today!</h1>
	<h1 style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size: 18px;">

	10/12/23: Today I made a console file and messed around with some javascript.  Thats all for today!
	<br>
	<br>
	10/19/23: Today I was learning how to make jumpscares.  I also added text to the homepage.  That's all!
	<br>
	<br>
	10/24/23: Started working on Spotispy jumpscare.  Don't wanna waste to much time writing in the journal so I'll end it here for today.
	<br>
	<br>
	10/26/23: Worked more on my jumpscare.  It's coming along nicely.
	<br>
	<br>
	11/2/23: I sketched my thanksgiving project for Amir and started coding it.
	<br>
	<br>
	11/7/23: I made a brownie generation site and learned more javascript.  Feeling good ad excited to code as always.
	<br>
	<br>
	11/9/23: I made the brownie variable project and helped others with their projects.
	<br>
	<br>
	11/16/23: I turned the brownie project into a gratitude card for amir but shhhhhhhh, don't tell him!
	<br>
	<br>
	11/30/23: I used chatgpt to answer my coding questions and showed amir his gift.  He didn't react to it, but I didn't expect him to.  Still waiting for him to surprise me with a card of my own.
	<br>
	<br>
	12/12/23: I finished my cake game project thingy based on the pizza game I was showed in class.  I'm hungry
	<br>
	<br>
	12/14/23: I added more to the cake game project thingy and updated some of the sprites as well as added links to my projects and re pushed my website.  Basically, just QOL things.
	<br>
	<br>
	12/19/23: I started making the blurry person guessing game with Anushka.
	<br>
	<br>
	1/9/24: I made an array random name picker.  I did it by using Math.round(math.random*5) which picks a random number from 0 to 4 because it will multiply a random value from 0 - 1 to 0 - 4 and round it to the nearest ones place to work with the array.
	<br>
	<br>
	1/18/24: Today I made a cool McDonalds ordering project with arrays.  Theres a list of my orders and it will randomly dispense it.  I also copied radient code to make a cool background.  It's pretty cool.
	<br>
	<br>
	2/1/24: Me and Ayla spent the ENTIRE CLASS trying to rotate an image on click.  It was painful and we failed on our original approach.  We eventually used a different approach (switching the image to a different version but flipped) but it was challenging to say the least.
	<br>
	<br>
	2/6/24: Me and Ayla brushed up our car code and did a model redo as the previous image would glitch and get all werid.
	<br>
	<br>
	2/8/24: Today I worked on brushing up some of my old projects and restored by github key which took a while.
	<br>
	<br>
	2/15/24: Today I made an "annoying-ness calculator" to prank my sister.  It is an input box that dispenses a random number unless you use the word "Cole".  That is all.
	<br>
	<br>
	2/22/24: Today I worked on making color picker and displayer projects.  I honestly learned a lot about the rgb code and other things like that.
	<br>
	<br>
	2/27/24: Today is my birthday (insert applause here).  I made sure my website was fully updated today.  Just to recap: array is mcdonalds project, Taco/Face/Pizza project is cake decorating, the car project is the car project, the valentine was turned into the movies I like because I don't have a valentine :(.  For my input one I made a how annoying are you to prank my sister and for the color project I messed around with differnt codes and sliders but decided not to publish it as I'm honestly not proud of it and I want to keep everything on my website viewable and polished.  That's all for today!
	<br>
	<br>
	2/29/24: Today I finished and republished my website.  I also made my slideshow about things that I wanted to due this weekend because honestly the weekend is the only thing on my mind.  I made it by deleting code and re-writing it while bug fixing it.</h1>
