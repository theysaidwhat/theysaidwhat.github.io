	<br>
	10/26/23: Worked more on my jumpscare.  It's coming along nicely.
	<br>
	<br>
	11/2/23: I sketched my thanksgiving project for Amir and started coding it.
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	11/9/23: I made the brownie variable project and helped others with their projects.
	<br>
	<br>
	11/16/23: I turned the brownie project into a gratitude card for amir but shhhhhhhh, don't tell him!
	<br>
	<br>
	11/30/23: I used chatgpt to answer my coding questions and showed amir his gift.  He didn't react to it, but I didn't expect him to.  Still waiting for him to surprise me with a card of my own.
	<br>
	<br>
	12/12/23: I finished my cake game project thingy based on the pizza game I was showed in class.  I'm hungry
	<br>
	<br>
	12/14/23: I added more to the cake game project thingy and updated some of the sprites as well as added links to my projects and re pushed my website.  Basically, just QOL things.
	<br>
	<br>
	12/19/23: I started making the blurry person guessing game with Anushka.
	<br>
	<br>
	1/9/24: I made an array random name picker.  I did it by using Math.round(math.random*5) which picks a random number from 0 to 4 because it will multiply a random value from 0 - 1 to 0 - 4 and round it to the nearest ones place to work with the array.
	<br>
	<br>
	1/18/24: Today I made a cool McDonalds ordering project with arrays.  It's pretty cool.</h1>
